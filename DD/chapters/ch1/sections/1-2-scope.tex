\section{Scope}
PowerEnJoy is inteded to be a management system for a car-sharing system that exclusively employs electrical powered cars.
The system allows users to find all the available cars near a given location which can be their current position or a specific address typed in. The user can book one of the cars available for a limited amount of time.
Once the booked car is reached by the user, it can be unlocked from one of the smart devices of the user. After entering a PIN, decided by the user during the registration phase, on the onboard computer, the engine can be started and the rental begins.
The cost of the service is calculated on the total duration of the rental multiplied by a fixed rate per minute. The user is continuously informed about the cost of the ongoing rental by the onboard computer.
The user can end the rental by parking the car and stopping the engine.

The PowerEnJoy platform is intended to be available on the major mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets running iOS \cite{ios} or Android \cite{android}.
