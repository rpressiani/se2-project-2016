\section{Overview}

A general introduction about the PowerEnJoy project has been given in this chapter. In the following chapters the reader will be provided with a more detailed description of the software design and the system architecture.

In Chapter 2, the overall system architecture is presented. Several models and paradigms have been exploited in order to describe the concepts clearly.

In Chapter 3, the model of the most critical aspects of the algorithm is provided. It explains the logical steps of the algorithm even if it cannot be consider as a real implementation.

In Chapter 4, the user experience and its interaction with the system are presented.

In Chapter 5, the requirements traceability will show which software components are needed in order to satisfy the feasibility of the goals described in the RASD.
