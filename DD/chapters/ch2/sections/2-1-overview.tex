\section{Overview}
The high level architecture of the PowerEnJoy system is composed by three tiers. For what concerns the mobile app and the car app, executed by the onboard computer, the \textit{view} tier is completely client side. The dektop app paradigm is slightly different. The static content of the web pages is retrieved from a web server and for this reason the \textit{view} tier is splitted betweeb client and server side.
