\section{Architectural Styles and Patterns}

\begin{labeling}{defs}
	\item[\textbf{MVC}] The entire system relies on the Model View Controller pattern. The view corresponds to the applications and the onboard computer, the APIServer implements the controllers while the model is represented by the database.
	\item[\textbf{Client-server}] All the communications among the entities of the architecture are based on the client-server pattern. A request is sent from the client that will receive a correspondent response synchronously or asynchronously.
