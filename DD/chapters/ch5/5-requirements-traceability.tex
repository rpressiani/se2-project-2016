\chapter{Requirements Traceability}
The component design of the system has been developed in order to cover all goals and requirements provided in the RASD. Below, the software component needed to guarantee each goal feasibility are reported.
The overall component design and interactions are shown in Figure (...).

\begin{itemize}

		\end{itemize}
	\item[{[G11]}] When a user is driving a car, the information about the ongoing rental is displayed by the onboard computer. The displayed information includes: the battery level of the car, the actual cost of the ongoing rental and a map that can be used as a GPS navigation device of to find both safe areas and special parking areas.
		\begin{itemize}

			\item CarController
			\item MapController
			\item RentalController
			\item RecoveryHelper
			\item PaymentHelper
			\item NotificationHelper
		\end{itemize}
	\item[{[G13]}] If the user shares the rented car with at least two passengers during the whole duration of the rental, he/she is eligible for a 10\% discount on the total cost of that rental.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item CarController
			\item RentalController
			\item PaymentHelper
		\end{itemize}
	\item[{[G14]}] If the user leaves a car with the battery level higher than 50\%, he/she is eligible for a 20\% discount on the last ride.

		\end{itemize}
	\item[{[G16]}] If the car is left at more than 3KM from the nearest specia parking area or with the battery charge lower than 20\%, the user will pay an extra fee that will correspond to the 30\% of the cost of the last ride.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item CarController
			\item MapController
			\item RentalController
			\item PaymentHelper
		\end{itemize}
	\item[{[G17]}] In case of low battery of a parked car, damaged car or empty battery, the car becomes unavailable until is recovered by an external company in order to fix all problems, depending on the situation, written above. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item CarController
			\item MapController
			\item RecoveryHelper
			\item NotificationHelper
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Router component and the Database are never mentioned above because the former is needed everytime a request is done by the clients to the server, while the latter is needed everytime a change in the system state happens.
