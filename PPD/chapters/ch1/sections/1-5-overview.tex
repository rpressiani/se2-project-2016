In this Chapter a first introduction of this Project Plan Document has been provided. In the following Chapters several aspects related to the PowerEnJoy project planning will be discussed.

In Chapter 2, an estimation of the expected size, cost and required effort of the project development will be provided. The Function Points approach will be exploited for the size estimation, while COCOMO II will be the approach used for the cost and effort estimation.

In Chapter 3, we are going to provide, thanks to a Gantt chart, a high-level project schedule, defining all main tasks necessary for developing the project.

In Chapter 4, we are going to provide, thanks to a Gantt chart, a general overview of how resources (in this case the two members of the team) have been assigned to various tasks of the project.

In Chapter 5, an analysis of the risk prevention and management will be provided. The risks identified and related to planning, technical and business issues and the possible strategies to overcome them will be discussed
