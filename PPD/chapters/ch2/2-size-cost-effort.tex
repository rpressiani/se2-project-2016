\chapter{Project size, cost and effort estimation}
This chapter provides an estimation of the expected size, cost and required effort of the PowerEnJoy project.

The size estimation will be based on the Function Points approach. This approach estimates the size of a software project starting from the functionalities that it has to offer. It is important to state that only the business logic has been taken into account, while the user applications have not been included in the estimation.

The cost and effort estimation will be based on the COCOMO II approach, starting from the SLOC value obtained from the size estimation.
