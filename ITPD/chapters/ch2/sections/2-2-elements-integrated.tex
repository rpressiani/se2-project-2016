\section{Elements to be Integrated}
In this section a list of all the components that need to be integrated is provided. We remind the reader that a complete view of the system components is provided in Section 2.3 of the Design Document.

First of all, the following components are the ones that together compose the core of the PowerEnJoy system:

\begin{itemize}
	\item UserController
	\item CarController
	\item MapController
	\item BookingController
	\item RentalController
\end{itemize}

Some of the functionalities implemented in the PowerEnJoy system are provided by external services. Helper components, such as PaymentHelper, NotificationHelper and RecoveryHelper, are in charge of the communications between the system and these third party services. Since the goal of these component is only to exchange formatted messages with the external services, the effort for their integration tests will be quite limited.

All the controllers that provide methods that can be called by the client applications need to be integrated with the Router component. The Router is the component in charge of receiving requests from the clients and to execute the right routines on the related controllers.

For what concerns the communication between the system and the database, an external library is used as an ORM.
